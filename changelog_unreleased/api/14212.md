#### Moves `@types/prettier` to `prettier/prettier` repository (#14212 by @sosukesuzuki)

Move the type definition files for TypeScript of the Prettier JavaScript API currently maintained in [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/) to Prettier's repository.

This saves users from having to install `@types/prettier`.
